GATHER

INTRODUCTION
---------------
Gather is a Java based web application that allows both individual hobbyists, hobby groups, or general interest groups to display and filter their specific interests in the application based on location and time. In this way, people can easily meet new friends with similar interests, especially when they are new to an area. Established hobby and interest groups can also attract new friends to join their group.
